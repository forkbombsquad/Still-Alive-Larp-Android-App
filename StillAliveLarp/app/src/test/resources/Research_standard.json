      "description": "A large monsterâ€”referred to as the Juggernautâ€”is believed to be linked to a group of masked, robed figures, hereby referred to as Cultists, living in the woods. Their staves drip with a substance tied to infection spread. Infection sites appear to worsen in areas connected to them. The creature itself remains unverified.\r\n\r\nStudying this group and their connection to these infection sites may help the camp better understand what weâ€™re dealing with.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSurvivor Research Log â€” Entry 1 Topic: Unconfirmed Entity â€” â€œJuggernautâ€�\r\n\r\nDate of Entry: August 24th, 2024\r\n\r\nSummary: Reports have emerged regarding a potential new infected entity, named â€œThe Juggernaut.â€� While no confirmed visual contact has been recorded, patterns have begun to form around its suspected activity.\r\n\r\nKey Observations:\r\n- Dr. Petrov: A letter recovered during the raid on the ritual site was addressed to Camp Still Alive. Its contents suggest that Dr. Petrov may hold a leadership role within the group cultists. The letter also included a direct threat, warning that the camp would not remain safe for long.\r\n\r\n- Cultists: Multiple sightings indicate the presence of robed, masked individuals in near major infection blooms. These figures carry staves that reportedly leak a viscous, dark fluidâ€” analysis pending (no samples retrieved).\r\n\r\n- Environmental Shift: Areas with increased sightings of the cultists show accelerated infection growth.\r\nReliability Index: Low-to-moderate. All current data is anecdotal. No visual confirmation of the Juggernautâ€™s form or capabilities exists.However, increasing evidence suggests that it poses a real threat.\r\nFurther research required. Contributions encouraged.\r\n\r\nActionable Notes:\r\n- Log and document all sightings of cultists.\r\n- Study new infection sites and find a way to dismantle them.\r\n- Learn how the cultists are communicating with each other.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMilestone 1\r\n\r\nSurvivor Research Log â€” Entry 2 Topic: Infection Sites\r\n\r\nDate of Entry:  June 21st, 2025\r\n\r\nObjective: Investigate a known infection site, document conditions, and study a physical fragment of the infection if safe.\r\n\r\nOutcome: Mission successful. Team returned with photographic evidence and detailed observations. No live sample was collected due to safety concerns.\r\n\r\nKey Findings:\r\n1. Heightened Hostility â€“ Zombies near the infection site showed increased aggression and strength. Recommend extreme caution around these sites..\r\n2. Perimeter Manipulation â€“ Team disrupted the outer infection ring using a makeshift bridge, creating a narrow passage through the site. This suggests the infectionâ€™s spread can be physically interrupted, at least temporarily.\r\n3. Containment Conclusion â€“ Infection sites show no signs of natural decay or permanent controllable regression. The team recommends complete destruction of affected areas via explosives to prevent spread.\r\n\r\nFurther documentation pending. Suggested next step: map infection site perimeters and flag possible demolition zones.\r\n\r\nField Notes: During the infection site sweep, a photograph was captured of a cultist emerging briefly from behind the treeline. The figure moved erraticallyâ€”drifting in and out of viewâ€”but made no direct attempt to engage.\r\n\r\nThis behavior suggests a level of reverence or surveillance tied to the site itself. The cultistâ€™s presence reinforces the theory that infection zones are of critical importance to their agenda. Continued efforts to dismantle and disrupt these areas are strongly justified.\r\n\r\nHand Drawn Image of an Infection Site incn the Research Binder.\r\n\r\nActionable Notes:\r\n- Design and prepare a portable explosive device capable of neutralizing localized infection sites without endangering surrounding terrain or survivors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMilestone 2\r\n\r\nSurvivor Research Log â€” Entry 3 Topic: The Cultist Cypher\r\n\r\nDate of Entry:  June 21st, 2025\r\n\r\nSummary: The team discovered five separate symbol sites, each consisting of carved glyphs arranged in deliberate sequences. Upon comparing the markings, survivors were able to decipher the full alphabet.\r\n\r\nKey Findings:\r\n- The glyphs appear to correspond to letters in a substitution cypher.\r\n- The presence of these symbols, organized across the five locations, suggests deliberate encoding meant for cultist communication.\r\n- Placement and repetition imply the cultists are leaving behind tools to decodeâ€”or reencodeâ€”future messages.\r\n\r\nA reference of the entire Compiled â€œCultist Cypherâ€� containing the full glyph alphabet can be found in the Research Binder. Survivors are encouraged to use this chart to decode future messages or symbols found on objects, walls, or ritual sites.\r\n\r\nNote: Team advises cautionâ€”symbols may also serve as markers or triggers for unknown Cultist behavior. Avoid disturbing them.",
