Everyone Iâ€™ve known either scattered or got killed. Friends, coworkersâ€¦ the only close family I had left, my dadâ€”dead. Couldnâ€™t tell you if my mom or older sister are still alive. My parents split when I was young and I was left alone with dad. Haven't seen those two since. I guess it's for the bestâ€”not knowing them.

My cat Mittens had been home the day Critter Cove descended into madness, so she was spared, and for the longest time she traveled with me. Until a zombie horde caught us off guard and she went running. I searched for weeks, but couldnâ€™t find my last friend in the world. \n\nMy wandering became quite aimless after that. I wasnâ€™t sure what I was doing anymore, or what my goal was. I was on autopilotâ€”survive. But to what end?

      "bio": "Itâ€™s been 4 years. 4 grueling years full of heartache and turmoil. \n\nIt started with a resident coming into work sick. Chest heaving, arms clammy to the touch. Seemed like any other Influenza A symptoms, so after giving him some electrolytes, we sent him on his way. Our small town biochem lab wasnâ€™t much, but we can manage a few emergency bags for someone with the flu. Itâ€™s not like it was seriousâ€¦.\n\nâ€”-\n\nA year later, my wife, daughter, and I are stumbling out of the local clinic two towns over, clutching what remained of their bagged emergency supplies. I stuffed an extra bottle of painkillers in my pocket. It was the only thing keeping me sane as the world started to fall apart. We all slammed our respective doors of our Jeep and I floored it down the street, narrowly avoiding the smattering of looters and cops darting in and out of stores. It was only a matter of time before this town crumbled, as well. I was beginning to think we were on the brink of something epidemic. I chased a pill with some tepid water from a bottle on my console. \n\nâ€”-\n\nMy wife and I cried in each others arms. Just dried up streaks of salty fear and pain lingering on our cheeks. No more tears. Our bodies simply couldnâ€™t handle it. Our beautiful daughter lay covered in a thin sheet of loose dirt at our feet, taken by the very same type of people who came to our clinics a year ago for help. One bite. Thatâ€™s all it took. It didnâ€™t matter that I disinfected the wound or kept it clean. It spread faster than we could manage it. My wife was no doctor, but she knew how to clean a scrape or a cut. This was something altogether different. We stared into each other's eyes, remembering all the tiny moments of happiness and joy our little girl brought us. All those feelings gone in a flash, by some slow-moving motherfucker who she helped into our makeshift camp. Itâ€™s been 3 years now, and all just about gone. My eyes blurred, but not from the tears that ought to have been there. But, rather, from the three pills I had popped only 20 minutes ago, as I dumped the final shovel full of dirt onto her lifeless corpse. She didnâ€™t deserve this. None of us did.\n\nâ€”\n\nThis was it. I had swallowed my last 3 painkillers barely half an hour earlier to numb my senses. I put the barrel of the gun into my mouth. I could barely call it a gun, though. Just some makeshift contraption I threw together in a cloudy effort to join my wife and daughter in the afterlife. I was a doctor. A skilled practitioner of health and surgery. I could stitch a shorn ventricle back together again with my eyes closed. But, this haphazardly, hastened-together chunk of steel and bedframe, barely holding in the 9mm round I carried around with me, ensured that I should meet them soon. Saying a final prayer, I squeezed the filed-down piece of spoon held together by duct tape and chewing gum, that cradled the firing pin. In a flash of light, the explosion rocked my head backward, and the world dipped into darkness, as my tongue was overwhelmed by the metallic taste of blood.\n\nâ€”\n\nI work up barely an hour later. My jaw ached, the back of my head in searing pain, and the room spinning. Peeling myself off the floor and sat, propping myself back up against the wall once more, I tried to focus my still-blurry gaze. God, my face was killing me. I remember looking down at my hand which still clutched pieces and fragments of the makeshift handgun I had fashioned out random metal. The barrel, if one could call it that, had exploded to the side, and the chamber the 9mm sat in had completely shredded. Little pieces of metal lay scattered across the ground, as I noticed flecks of blood across my hand. Gleams of silvery steel embedded in my fingers and wrist reminded me that I was no weaponsmith. My other hand still clutched the empty pill bottle, but I had scarcely noticed a random stray pill had rolled out of my pocket. I hastily scooped it up, leaning down to grab it, and wincing at the intense pain my face. I jammed the painkiller in my mouth without thinking, and quickly recoiled my hand in a revulsion of excruciating agony. Squeezing my eyes tightly shut to dull the aching of my jaw, I reopened them to see my hand absolutely covered in fresh blood. As I wiped it on my shirt, I noticed it too was heavily drenched with a now, slightly-dried pool. Reaching into my pocket once more, I fished aimlessly for my cellphone, lifting it up and briefly squinting at the light, as it lit up with a picture of my wife and daughter. Suppressing a pang of sadness, I clicked on the camera app and switched to the self-facing lens. A wave of nausea hit me, as I was met with an unrecognizably grotesque, brutally mauled face of a man. One side of my face hung loosely off my skull, as skin flaps poured freshly jostled blood pockets onto my already-soaked shirt. The realization that I had blown apart the left side of my head sent new shivers of pain through my face. Grimacing, I dropped the scrap-made weapon and put the cellphone on the ground, propped up with the flashlight on, as it was approaching mid-evening. Mustering remaining bits of my strength, I tore a shred off the dry portion of my shirt and dug through my nearby bag for some disinfectant and bactine. Taking a deep breath, I applied the soaked rag to my face, shuddering violently at the pain. After fully cleaning it, I could feel the effects of my last and final painkiller kicking in. Taking a fresh gauze wrap from my bag along with some needle and thread, I gripped my phone once more and stitched my shredded tapestry of a face back together.\n\nâ€”\n\nThe next morning, I awoke to a fresh onslaught of pain. The wound had been patched and could begin healing, but it would be a testament to the end point of my life. In the darkest moments, my life had been spared by my girls. Somewhere, great beyond, they held my hand through the night to ensure Iâ€™d live to see another day. Tears once again slipped their way down my cheeks, sending tingles of salty pain, as they hit my freshly sewn wound. I had to keep going. I couldnâ€™t let their gift go to waste. Carefully pouring the last of my bottle of water and 2000mg of a mixture of various Tylenols and Advils into my mouth, I scooped up my bag, and slowly ambled toward the door. Kicking away the chairs and coffee tables I had propped up against it, I was met with a glaring morning light through the gaping doorway. Somewhere, something had to exist to stop this thing. And my girls ensured that I lived long enough to find it.",

Alongside his interest in technology, Steve also developed a passion for survivalism, inspired by his father, a former military man turned doomsday prepper.\n\nSteve spent his high school years balancing coding projects with learning survival skills. He and his father often went on weekend camping trips, practicing building shelters, purifying water, and living off the land. These experiences instilled in Steve a deep appreciation for self-sufficiency and preparedness.\n\nAfter high school, Steve earned a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he majored in Computer Science. During his college years, he focused on cybersecurity and systems programming. He also joined the university's Hoofers club, where he shared his bushcraft knowledge and learned new techniques.\n\nWhen the infection hit in 2020, Steve's dual passions for technology and survival proved invaluable.

Within a day my husband was sick and two days later he died. \n\nI have been making my way south going from camp to camp looking for my daughters. I am avoiding people as Iâ€™m able. While hiding in the brush, I overheard passerbyâ€™s talking about camp Davis about an hour away. They claim itâ€™s safe and others are there. My daughters just might be there. ",

      "bio": "Amateur model and Occultist Sarah Toriel went to a small town school in Minnesota, nearby a fox sanctuary that her mother worked for.\n\nAfter meeting the owner of the sanctuaryâ€™s daughter, Sarah was invited to join a coven with a few of her peers she knew from school. She and her new friends would perform rituals in the forests nearby the sanctuary. Most of it was always in good fun and never harmful or dangerous. \n\nWhen the bigger cities began getting sickness on mass, she retreated to the sanctuary with her family and some of her friends. After several weeks of waiting around and picking up some new skills being taught around the camp, she got extremely bored, thinking the coven leader unfit for leading them anymore.\n\nFor several days she would very carefully and secretively collect raw meat in a freezer. On a full moon, she held a ritual in the center of the sanctuary, letting out all of the animals from their habitats. During the chaos, a fire started during a heated argument between Serah and the coven leader. \n\nOf course, all of this had drawn the attention of a nearby zombie horde and led to the destruction of the settlement. Believing to be the only survivor, she traveled alone across the land joining small groups here and there, but eventually made her way to camp Still Alive. \n\nShe now goes by a different name, Sayaka Tsukino, inspired by her anime interests and maybe a little deranged belief that she has become a Japanese trickster demon through her ritual and â€˜trialsâ€™. Who knows how long she'll continue to be lucky~",

She had even been accepted to West Point until an injury caused her to drop out. After that she took up long haul truck driving which suited her just fine. It was just her and her cat Egg and the road ahead of her. It was lonely and it wasn't what she wanted, but it kept food in her belly and things weren't too bad. \n\nShe was taking a shipment up to Canada when the plague broke out. A zombie ran in front of her truck and in an attempt to avoid it she swerved hard right, lost control, and flipped her vehicle at 80 miles an hour. Now she finds herself in Camp Still Alive with a second chance to be the leader she never managed to be in the world before everything went to shit. There's only one thing missing. She can't find her cat.",

There was constant discussion of life after the apocalypse, what they would do, how they would survive.

Evie never minded these little activities since she never believed it would happen, but as is always the case, it turned out her mom was right. \n\nThe outbreak began while she was in Wisconsin for grad school studying epidemiology. What seemed like a fascinating case study was the beginning of the end. Now sheâ€™s stuck up north, trying to survive the cold. and debating whether itâ€™s worth it to brave the expanse of zombies between Wisconsin and Florida, and admitting her parents were right, to see her family again.
