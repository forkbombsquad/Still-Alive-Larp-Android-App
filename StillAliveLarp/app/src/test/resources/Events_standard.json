While Commander Davis is hard at work trying to establish communication, create trade routes, and form alliances with the radio tower; the first task on the docket for the rest of the camp is to take care of the massive mudslide that plagues the upper trail. However, the long winter may have brought in more danger than what meets the eye. Survivors have started to go missing as of late - walking off on patrols and not returning in numbers far larger than can be attributed to standard zombie attacks alone. The Commander has made a posting about it on the quest board for any souls brave (or stupid) enough to try and figure out what's going on.\n\n3pm - 5pm: Check-In and tent setup\n\nCommander's Feast:\nPulled pork sandwiches \nMac and cheese \nAssorted veggies \n\nRaffle: \n1xp \n1 free tier one skill \n3 cloth materials",
